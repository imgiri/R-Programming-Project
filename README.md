# R-Programming-Project
Being Captain of the NIT Jamshedpur Cricket Team I 
Created a dataset of NIT Jamshedpur's Cricket Team members in order to select 
the best 11 for a particular match by getting insights from the data using R programming

#Dataset consists data of few matches which will be updated 
# match by match in order to visualise data effectively,so that I can be
#able to select Best Playing 11 as per the stats and requirement of the team.

#I will be having more sinsights by this project and the job of picking the 
#best 11 players will be get easy for me.
